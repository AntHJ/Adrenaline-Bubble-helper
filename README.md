# Adrenaline-Bubble-helper - I Know its not perfect, but its helpful

**ABOUT**

 This tool will resize images to the required sizes for the Adrenaline Bubble Manager
 and also convert them to 8 bit png images..

 for best results, try and use images of a similar size/ratio for its use..

	Bubble		=	128 x 128
	Background	=	840 x 500
	Start Button	=	280 x 158
	Launch Screen	=	960 x 544

	Manual pages / Additional images = 960 x 544


 The Location of the Start/Launch button can be changed from the default location

	Middle		= the same location as the Settings app
 	Right		= the same location as VitaShell
	Upper Right	= the same location as the NEAR app


** TRANSFER THE FILES **

 Transfer the created folder / converted images to your Vitas UX0: so for example
 you would have something like this

			\bg0.png

			\Manual\001.png
